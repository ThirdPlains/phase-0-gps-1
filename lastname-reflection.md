#Questions for GPS 1.1 

**1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?** 

Prior to the GPS session the concept I was struggling with the most was memorizing some of the commands like "git co -b" and "git commit -m", but after the GPS I feel more comfortable using them without looking at my notes.

**2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I like how this GPS had more step-by-step instructions on how the Git workflow works. Some of the previous challenges assumed that you already knew some of the stuff so I would have to go back to the videos to figure out what they meant. 

**3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Since I was not able to make my GPS, I did not work with a pair or guide. 

**4. What still confuses you about Git?**

The only thing that sometimes confuses me is having to create a feature branch then a file within that branch to make updates. 

**5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

Since I have not had a GPS yet, I dont have anything to say about it but I do like the pair sessions with other people.
